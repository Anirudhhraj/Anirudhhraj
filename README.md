## About

I build machine learning systems that actually ship to production. Over the past semester, I've implemented generative models from first principles, deployed production-grade cloud infrastructure, and built quantitative trading algorithms—all while maintaining a systematic, research-driven approach to problem-solving.

What sets my work apart is the rare combination of deep ML knowledge and production infrastructure expertise. I don't just train models in notebooks—I architect the AWS pipelines to deploy them, write the Terraform to provision resources, and build the CI/CD automation to ship updates without downtime. This dual capability stems from genuine curiosity about how systems work end-to-end, from gradient descent mathematics to load balancer health checks.

My projects reflect a pattern: identify a hard problem, build a solution from scratch rather than relying on pre-built frameworks, validate rigorously with metrics, and iterate based on empirical results. Whether it's discovering that weight-tied decoding makes text diffusion viable, debugging teacher forcing to eliminate repetition, or engineering features that capture market dynamics—I prioritize understanding over implementation shortcuts.

Currently seeking roles where I can apply this builder mindset to real-world data and ML infrastructure challenges. I thrive in environments that value systematic thinking, empirical validation, and the ability to translate research insights into production systems.
